# riverpod-pagination-example

This is the complete code example for the
article [Riverpod Pagination: The Ultimate Guide for Flutter Developers](https://dinkomarinac.dev/riverpod-pagination-the-ultimate-guide-for-flutter-developers).

The project uses the the GitHub API, and demonstrates how to do pagination,
sorting, and filtering with Riverpod's AsyncNotifier.

If you encounter an error 403 when running the project, it's because you've
exceeded the rate limit for the GitHub API. You can create a personal access
token and use it in the project.

Run the project with the token by running the following command:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
```
